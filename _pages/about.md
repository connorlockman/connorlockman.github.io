I'm a current graduate student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Master of Science in data science.  I'm interested in applying data analysis, data visualization, and predictive analytic techniques to enable people to make more informed, data driven decisions.  I believe in making complex machine learning insights palatable to all people, regardless of background.  In doing so, I hope to seek creative, well founded solutions to the toughest problems we face.
