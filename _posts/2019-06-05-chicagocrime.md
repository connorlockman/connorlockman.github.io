This visualization was produced to highlight the proximity between Chicago's elementary schools and the locations of homicides around the city during 2018.  We can see large clusters of violence on the South and West sides of the city which often occur on schools' doorsteps.

This project was produced in plot.ly leveraging python and pandas with data consumed from the city of Chicago's Socrata open data API.  You can visit this link: <https://plot.ly/~connorlockman/20/#/> to zoom in and out in the map.
